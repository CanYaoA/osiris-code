### OSIRIS Development Branch

The OSIRIS development branch has all the newest features and optimizations being introduced into the code. It allows OSIRIS developers to test new features and optimizations without disturbing the stable branch. This branch has a number of new features and optimizations not available in the stable branch, so more advanced users are encouraged to use this branch instead. As more users test the code, the faster it will be tested and debugged, and the faster we will be able to incorporate these new features into the stable branch.

This branch has differences in terms of input file from the stable branch, please check the [reference guide](reference/index.md) to see how you can update your input files.
