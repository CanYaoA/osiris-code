# Acknowledging OSIRIS

All scientific work using OSIRIS, OSIRIS-H and visXD must acknowledge
its authors, as defined by the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) giving
users access to the infrastructure. See below for the guidelines
pertaining each framework.

## OSIRIS

All scientific work using OSIRIS should acknowledge the OSIRIS
Consortium. As of January 2011, the guidelines are:

- In papers:
  - Acknowledgement section of the paper must include the following
    text:"*The authors would like to acknowledge the OSIRIS Consortium,
    consisting of UCLA and IST (Lisbon, Portugal) for the use of OSIRIS,
    for providing access to the OSIRIS framework*".
  - Reference to the OSIRIS paper should be: *R. A. Fonseca* et al.,
    LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE 2331: 342-351 (2002)
- In talks:
  - Talk must include the official OSIRIS 2.0 slide or the official
    OSIRIS 2.0 logo (including the IST and UCLA logos), available at the
    IST OSIRIS web site.
  - Speaker should mention explicitly the Consortium as the distributor
    of the OSIRIS version being used.
- In conference and workshop presentations:
  - Poster must include the official OSIRIS 2.0 slide or the official
    OSIRIS 2.0 logo (including the IST and UCLA logos), available at the
    IST OSIRIS web site.
- In grant proposals/applications:
  - For grant proposals/applications that include the use and
    development of OSIRIS, the OSIRIS consortium should be contacted.

## OSIRIS-H

All scientific work using OSIRIS-H should acknowledge the OSIRIS
Consortium. As of January 2011, the guidelines are:

- In papers:
  - Acknowledgement section of the paper must include the following
    text:"*The authors would like to acknowledge the OSIRIS Consortium,
    consisting of UCLA and IST (Lisbon, Portugal) for the use of OSIRIS,
    for providing access to the OSIRIS-H framework*".
  - Reference to the OSIRIS and OSIRIS-H papers should be:
    - *R. A. Fonseca* et al., LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE 2331:
      342-351 (2002)
    - *F. Fi√∫za* et al., Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, 53(7),
      074004 (2012)
- In talks:
  - Talk must include the official OSIRIS-H slide or the official OSIRIS
    2.0 logo (including the IST and UCLA logos), available at the IST
    OSIRIS web site.
  - Speaker should mention explicitly the Consortium as the distributor
    of the OSIRIS version being used.
- In conference and workshop presentations:
  - Poster must include the official OSIRIS 2.0 slide or the official
    OSIRIS 2.0 logo (including the IST and UCLA logos), available at the
    IST OSIRIS web site.
- In grant proposals/applications:
  - For grant proposals/applications that include the use and
    development of OSIRIS, the OSIRIS consortium should be contacted.

## visXD

All scientific work using visXD should acknowledge the OSIRIS
Consortium. As of January 2012, the guidelines are:

- In papers:
  - If the paper already acknowledges the use of OSIRIS it is sufficient
    to add visXD to the acknowledgement: *"The authors would like to
    acknowledge the OSIRIS Consortium, consisting of UCLA and IST
    (Lisbon, Portugal) for the use of OSIRIS **and the visXD
    framework.**"*
  - Otherwise the acknowledgement section of the paper must include the
    following text: *"The authors would like to acknowledge the OSIRIS
    Consortium, in particular IST (Lisbon, Portugal), for providing
    access to the visXD framework."*
  - The reference to the visXD paper must be included explicitly:
    - *R.A. Fonseca*, et. al., Plasma Phys Contr Fusion, 50 (2008) p.
      124034.
- In talks:
  - If the talk already includes the official OSIRIS 2.0 slide or OSIRIS
    2.0 logo (including the IST and UCLA logos), available at the IST
    OSIRIS web site, no additional information is required.
  - Otherwise, the talk must include the official visXD logo (including
    the IST logo), also available at the IST OSIRIS web site.
  - Speaker should mention explicitly the Consortium as the distributor
    of the visXD version being used.
- In conference and workshop presentations:
  - If the poster already include the official OSIRIS 2.0 slide or the
    official OSIRIS 2.0 logo (including the IST and UCLA logos),
    available at the IST OSIRIS web site, no additional information is
    required.
  - Otherwise, the poster must include the official visXD logo
    (including the IST logos), also available at the IST OSIRIS web
    site.
- In grant proposals/applications:
  - For grant proposals/applications that include the use and
    development of visXD, IST should be contacted.
